This project was the first that utilized data that was stored in MSSQL. 

I built the project in python, and had the freedom to chose whatever area of analysis I would like providing there was data for it in the dataset.

I settled on running a cost-efficiency analysis of the salespeople in the imaginary company that the data is based upon. 

This was done by summing all costs - salary + bonuses + expenses and summing all sales for each salesman, and calculating the cost-efficiency of every employee based on this newly created data. 

I manipulated data in MSSQL in order to get this information, as it was not readily available prior to the analysis. 

I also built some visualizations of the data that I had built and ran some statistical tests to check for significance.
