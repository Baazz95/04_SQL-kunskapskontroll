This was the first project in which I utilized SQL server to build an analysis. I was free to choose what my analysis would be on, and I decided to therefore run a cost-benefit analysis of salespeople in the company (heartless, I know). 

I built my analysis in python, and pulled the data from the database that was stored in MSSQL. 

There were a few challenges that I ran into in this project, but I actually really enjoyed seeing the end result come together. 

Overall, seeing the cost-efficiency of the employees was really interesting, and I also ran some statistical tests to check for significance (as there was a relatively small sample size of salespeople overall).
